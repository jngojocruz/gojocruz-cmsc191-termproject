## Artificial Neural Network for Predicting the Protein Localization Sites in Yeast
Abstract â€“ Protein mislocalization contributes to the development of a variety of human diseases. Thus, automating protein localization became crucial and has been a prominent area of research in bioinformatics since this provides the physiological environment for their function. Among the machine learning algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) shown significant improvement in predicting the classes of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or yeast data set, containing 1484 samples. This study developed an ANN. Input with 8 attributes and output variables categorized into 10 classes were encoded. The input layer that corresponds to the attributes of the amino acid sequences, two hidden layers uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, and the output layer uses Softmax for multi-class classification. SMOTE is applied to aid the data imbalance among the class. To evaluate the model, accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC AUC as metrics are used. The ANN model resulted in an accuracy of 81% on training and 51% on the test data set, compared to the initial classification accuracy of 55% of the pioneer study.
